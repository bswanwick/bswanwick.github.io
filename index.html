          <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
          <p>
            Chief Software Engineer (and Webmaster!) Blaise Swanwick, checking
            in. I appreciate you taking the time to read this. As a little
            reward, please seek and find the easter eggs hidden throughout the
            site. They are there to reward the curious and the diligent. I hope
            you enjoy your stay!
          </p>
          <h4>Bio</h5>
          <p>
            I started programming at the age of 12 in C++. That is, dareisay, a <i>real programming language</i>. 
            From there, I have learned a dozen or so languages, including Java, C#, ColdFusion, ASP, PHP, JS, and Python. 
            I used to write games on my TI-83 calculator and share them with my friends back in high school.  That should help
            put things into perspective a bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also a product development specialist. I've brought multiple apps and platforms from idea to production for
            banks, universities, airports, kiosk manufacturers, scientists, and the
            federal government.  In most of my roles, I've been both the "Product Manager" and the "Engineering Manager". 
            One of my most enjoyable projects was a 508/ADA compliant Airport Information kiosk.  
            I personally led UX research groups with a local nonprofit to ensure the kiosk was accessible to all. I also developed a bespoke screenreading solution built on React and NVDA. 
            Besides leading product development and UX research, I also led the development team to ensure the kiosk was secure, reliable, and compliant.
            It has certainly been a wild ride so far, and I can't wait to see what's next!
          </p>
          <p>
            I've worked on everything from small websites to large enterprise  
            applications supporting many different runtimes. I'm always looking
            for new opportunities to learn and grow. There's a very good chance I
            am learning something new right now at this very moment!
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Some of my favorite things are:</b>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Learning new things</li>
            <li>Helping others</li>
            <li>Creating things</li>
            <li>Exploring new places</li>
            <li>Meeting new people</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Please check out and enjoy the site. It's a work in progress, but
            I'm always adding new things. Find any easter eggs yet?! Almost
            everything was hand-crafted in raw HTML, CSS, and JS &hyphen; with a
            text editor. Why? Because this is my hobby project, and I wanted to
            avoid industrial level tooling. It is time to get back to my roots!
            <i>(with the help of just a few key libraries, like GSAP)</i>
