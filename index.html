          <h3>Hello, World!</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a software engineer and technical product manager with almost 20
            years of experience. I've worked on everything from small websites
            to large enterprise applications supporting many different runtimes.
            I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. There's
            a very good chance I am learning something new right now at this
            very moment!
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Some of my favorite things are:</b>
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Learning new things</li>
            <li>Helping others</li>
            <li>Creating things</li>
            <li>Exploring new places</li>
            <li>Meeting new people</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Please check out and enjoy the site. It's a work in progress, but
            I'm always adding new things. Find any easter eggs yet?! Almost
            everything was hand-crafted in raw HTML, CSS, and JS &hyphen; with a
            text editor. Why? Because this is my hobby project, and I wanted to
            avoid industrial level tooling. It is/was time to get back to my
            roots...with the help of just a few key libraries (GSAP!).
          </p>
          <h4>My history with computing</h4>
          <p>
            I was born a little late for the early days of Usenet and BBS, but I
            remember our local ISP had pay per minute websites for certain games
            and content. Dialup charges to the tune of $1 &hyphen; $5 / minute!
            I remember my first computer was a windows 4.1 machine. We played
            Lemmings and Snake. I found a "Python" icon somewhere on the C:
            drive and thought it was another game like Snake. The indecipherable
            UI and text therein mystified me. From there, I was writing my own
            games on a TI-83. C++ was my first real language, followed by Java,
            and C#.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now I'm an engineering leader and product development specialist.
            I've brought multiple apps and platforms from idea to production for
            international banks, presitigous universities, airports, airlines,
            chemists, and the federal government. It's been a wild ride, and I
            can't wait to see what's next!
          </p>
